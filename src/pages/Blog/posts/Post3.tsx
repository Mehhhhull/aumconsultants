              The Indian government offers numerous schemes, subsidies, and support programs designed to help small enterprises thrive. However, many business owners remain unaware of these opportunities or find the application process overwhelming. This comprehensive guide will help you navigate the landscape of government support available for your business.

              Understanding the MSME Landscape
            </h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) form the backbone of the Indian economy, contributing significantly to GDP, employment, and exports. Recognizing their importance, the government has created a robust ecosystem of support mechanisms to help these businesses overcome challenges and grow sustainably.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
              The first step in accessing government support is obtaining MSME registration through the Udyam Registration portal. This free, online process provides you with a unique identification number and unlocks access to various schemes and benefits.
            </p>

            <h2 className="font-heading text-3xl font-bold text-foreground mt-12 mb-6">
              Key Government Schemes for MSMEs
            </h2>

            <h3 className="font-heading text-2xl font-semibold text-foreground mt-8 mb-4">
              1. Prime Minister's Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP)
            </h3>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
              PMEGP is a credit-linked subsidy program that provides financial assistance for setting up new micro-enterprises in the non-farm sector. The scheme offers subsidies ranging from 15% to 35% of the project cost, with the remaining amount available as bank loans at favorable terms.
            </p>

              2. Credit Guarantee Fund Scheme for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE)
            </h3>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
              One of the biggest challenges for small businesses is providing collateral for loans. CGTMSE addresses this by providing credit guarantees to banks, enabling MSMEs to access collateral-free loans up to ₹2 crore.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
              <strong className="text-foreground">Coverage:</strong> The scheme covers 75% to 85% of the loan amount, significantly reducing the risk for lenders and making it easier for MSMEs to secure financing for both new ventures and existing business expansion.
            </p>

            <h3 className="font-heading text-2xl font-semibold text-foreground mt-8 mb-4">

            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
              CLCSS encourages technology upgradation in MSMEs by providing a 15% capital subsidy (limited to ₹15 lakh) on institutional finance availed for technology upgradation. This scheme helps businesses modernize their operations and improve competitiveness.

            </h3>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Designed to promote entrepreneurship among women and Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes, Stand-Up India facilitates bank loans between ₹10 lakh and ₹1 crore for greenfield enterprises in manufacturing, services, or trading sectors.
            </p>
